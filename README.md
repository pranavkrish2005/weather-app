# React weather app to view current weather and forecast in any city


## A simple react weather app using GeoDB Cities and weatherapi.com that shows the current weather in a city and the future forecast

This project uses the GeoDB Cities and weatherapi.com to collect cities and data about the current and future weather in the town up to 3 days in advance.

### Important note: only cities with a minimum population of 100,000 or higher can be found.

The api.js file where I have the API keys is not public. So, please when downloading this and replicating this on your own create your own api keys and an api.js file.
